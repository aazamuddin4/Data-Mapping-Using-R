# Data-Mapping-Using-R
# My first personal project proposed by my internship supervisor from the BRD Training and then further researched with my final year project supervisor at University Technology of Malaysia

# Explanation on the whole project - objective, purpose, goals, etc. 
# Once extracting the whole file, open project file in Rstudio namely brd_training_2019.html or .Rmd  depends on where you want to open the file

# The data(s)
# The data obtained were recorded at an industrial area where it is assumed to have high level of radiation

# API key 
# API key is used in this project on Google Cloud Platform
# This is important to authorize the access of Google using their google map 

# Equipment
# Most suitable equipment used is Teledyne FLIR Introduces New identiFINDER R700 Backpack Radiation Detector which is has a feature where it detects a very specific radiation level on a very small change of coordinates

# Types of Maps
# Heat map - variation on color depends on a density area 
# Plot point coordinates - more specific detail on the radiation level
